# FinSense-AI-Python

This project involves two key tasks:

**Predicting Credit Card Payment Ability**:
A Gradient Boosting model is used to predict whether a credit card member will default on their payment based on financial features like balance, credit limit, income, and payment history. The model is trained on synthetic data, evaluated for accuracy, and the results (predictions) are saved for further analysis.

**Identifying Financial Stress Signals Using NLP and Clustering**:
Customer interaction data (text-based) is processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF, to extract meaningful features. A clustering algorithm (KMeans) then groups customers into clusters based on financial stress signals derived from their interactions.

**Model Monitoring and Reporting**:
The results from both models, including performance metrics and insights, are saved in CSV format. A monitoring report is generated to document the models' purpose, performance, and use cases for business stakeholders.

This approach combines machine learning and NLP to enhance decision-making by predicting risks and uncovering stress patterns in customer behavior.
